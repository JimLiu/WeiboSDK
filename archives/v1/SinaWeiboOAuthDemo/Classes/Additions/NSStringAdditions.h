/**
 * Compares two strings expressing software versions.
 *
 * The comparison is (except for the development version provisions noted below) lexicographic
 * string comparison. So as long as the strings being compared use consistent version formats,
 * a variety of schemes are supported. For example "3.02" < "3.03" and "3.0.2" < "3.0.3". If you
 * mix such schemes, like trying to compare "3.02" and "3.0.3", the result may not be what you
 * expect.
 *
 * Development versions are also supported by adding an "a" character and more version info after
 * it. For example "3.0a1" or "3.01a4". The way these are handled is as follows: if the parts
 * before the "a" are different, the parts after the "a" are ignored. If the parts before the "a"
 * are identical, the result of the comparison is the result of NUMERICALLY comparing the parts
 * after the "a". If the part after the "a" is empty, it is treated as if it were "0". If one
 * string has an "a" and the other does not (e.g. "3.0" and "3.0a1") the one without the "a"
 * is newer.
 *
 * Examples (?? means undefined):
 *   "3.0" = "3.0"
 *   "3.0a2" = "3.0a2"
 *   "3.0" > "2.5"
 *   "3.1" > "3.0"
 *   "3.0a1" < "3.0"
 *   "3.0a1" < "3.0a4"
 *   "3.0a2" < "3.0a19"  <-- numeric, not lexicographic
 *   "3.0a" < "3.0a1"
 *   "3.02" < "3.03"
 *   "3.0.2" < "3.0.3"
 *   "3.00" ?? "3.0"
 *   "3.02" ?? "3.0.3"
 *   "3.02" ?? "3.0.2"
